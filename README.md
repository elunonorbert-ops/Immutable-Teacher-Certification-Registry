# 📜 Immutable Teacher Certification Registry

Welcome to a revolutionary blockchain-based solution for teacher certifications! This project creates an immutable registry on the Stacks blockchain to store and verify teaching credentials, making it easier for educators to pursue cross-border hiring opportunities. No more bureaucratic hurdles—certifications are tamper-proof, globally accessible, and instantly verifiable by schools, governments, and employers worldwide.

## ✨ Features

🔒 Immutable storage of certification details, preventing forgery or alteration  
🌍 Cross-border validation rules to check compatibility with international standards  
📋 Teacher profiles with linked certifications and work history  
✅ Instant verification for employers via smart contract queries  
💼 Integration with hiring platforms through APIs (off-chain)  
🚫 Dispute resolution mechanism for challenged certifications  
💰 Fee system for issuers and premium verifications  
🔍 Audit trails for all registry actions  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project leverages 8 smart contracts written in Clarity to build a secure, decentralized system. Here's a high-level overview:

**For Teachers**  
- Register your profile using TeacherProfileContract.  
- Submit certification details (e.g., scanned docs hashed) to an authorized issuer via CertificationIssuerContract.  
- Receive an NFT from CertificationNFTContract as proof—share your NFT ID with potential employers.  
- Update your profile as needed, but certifications remain locked.  

**For Issuers (e.g., Educational Authorities)**  
- Get authorized through admin functions in CertificationIssuerContract.  
- Issue a certification by calling mint-nft in CertificationNFTContract, including a hash of the original document.  
- Pay a small fee via FeeHandlerContract to incentivize network security.  

**For Employers/Verifiers**  
- Query VerificationContract with an NFT ID to confirm details and validity.  
- Use CrossBorderValidatorContract to check if the certification meets your country's requirements.  
- If suspicious, initiate a dispute via DisputeResolutionContract for community review.  

**For Auditors**  
- Access full history through AuditLogContract to review any action without needing off-chain data.  

That's it! Deploy these contracts on Stacks, and you've got a scalable solution to a global hiring pain point. Start by cloning this repo and testing on the Stacks testnet.
